# ATMS559 basic analysis for HW2

## Get on the NCAR Jupyter Hub. I recommend using Chrome for your browser.

[jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/hub/home](https://jupyterhub.hpc.ucar.edu/stable/hub/home) 

## Installation

You will need to install the code from a Terminal on NCAR's system,
either Casper or Derecho. To get to a Terminal, go to the + tab at the
top of this section on Jupyter Hub desktop, then find the Terminal
icon and click it.

I recommend putting this code either in your home or work space on
NCAR's computes. For example, if you want to use your work directory
(like I do below) first go to that directory using the cd command from
the Terminal and then issue the git clone command as follows:

```
cd /glade/work/$USER
git clone https://github.com/cmbitz/ATMS559-hw2-analysis.git
```

## Start the notebook
Navigate to the directory whee you just put the code with the directory tree on the left.
Click on the notebook TOA_ERF_ECS.ipynb

If you need to choose a python environment, NPL 2024a worked for me
